    <body>
        <p>The Sun and The Star is a book by Rick Riordan that follows the story of two demigods, Nico di Angelo and Will Solace, two characters in Rick Riordans ongoing Percy Jackson series. This book follows the characters as they go on a quest to save their friend, the book is extremely humourous, filled with adventure and emotion. Will Solace and Nico Di Angelo are two of the growing number of queer characters within this franchise and in order to properly write them the author has brought on queer co-author Mark Oshiro.</p>

    </subtitle3>

    <body>
        <p>I really loved this book. I love Rick Riordans' choice to partner with a queer author so he could authentically write these characters, that is something any straight person writing queer characters should do, get insight from a queer person. I am so happy this book was released because these are two of my favourite characters and I love that they've been getting more attention recently. I thought this book was well written and very interesting, I love seeing queer people represented in media and there is actually a sequel to this book coming out later this year and I'm very excited to see what happens next.</p>

    </subtitle5>

    <body>
        <p>This book was incredible, it was slightly different to what I usually read but I was completely hooked. Silas is a surgeon so there are some rather graphic descriptions but I ended up learning some new terms. This book is so incredible in representing the transgender experience, it also deals with the toleration of autism and society's manipulation of women incredibly well. Andrew Joseph White has an incredible style of writing and I plan to read many more of his books.</p>

<body>
    <p>This book was a great read. There was so much backstory and the world was slightly complex which is admittedly slightly confusing at times, but it's also weirdly easy and soothing. This book is wonderful if you're looking for a nice read it's mostly built on the girls individual inner turmoils while also having the romance between the two as the other main focus. I really enjoyed seeing lots of development within the characters throughout the book it has wonderful descriptions and is generally very pleseant. It unfortunately didn't score as highly as the other books just because it gtakes a little to really get into it and sometimes the backstory is slightly confusing, but I still recommend it if you want a fantasy queer romance.</p>
